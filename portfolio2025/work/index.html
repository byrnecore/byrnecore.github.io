          <p>
            I‚Äôve spent my career at the intersection of product and design - helping teams build with purpose, speed, and empathy. No one understands your users better than they do, which is why I ground everything in real-world needs, tested ideas, and scalable systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve worked on and led a plethora of products and projects. Some tactical. Some strategic. Though, all Lean-Agile, measured and incremental.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's some of my chosen works for you:

            <h2 class="split-title">black.ai ‚Äî From R&D to global SaaS</h2>
            <p class="muted">Head of Product & Design</p>
            <p>Black.ai helps retailers see what was previously invisible ‚Äî how people actually move through their stores. I worked with customers to validate the real problems, quantify the market opportunity, and design solutions that met their needs. In just three months we shipped the first MVP, including Segment Builder (a no-code query tool) and Journey Player (multi-camera playback), balancing tough trade-offs like SQL vs no-code flexibility and playback clarity vs computer vision accuracy.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Secured Walmart, Woolworths, Adore Beauty, HEB, and Milkrun ‚Äî the most client acquisitions in Black.ai‚Äôs history. Doubled delivery velocity and sustained 80% NPS.</p>

            <p class="muted">Head of User Expereince</p>
            <p>
              Openpay is a buy now, pay later fintech scaling from Australia to the UK and beyond. The company had strong engineering capability but no product design practice, outdated apps, and poor reviews. I defined design goals, audited existing products, and consolidated research from social media, reviews, service contacts, and surveys. Working with a newly built cross-functional team, I led the design of new iOS and Android apps, introduced a design system, simplified onboarding, and addressed major accessibility issues.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Despite shipping later than planned, the UK launch exceeded expectations ‚Äî generating more revenue than Australia within two months. The apps established design and product practices that enabled Openpay‚Äôs global expansion.</p>

            <p class="muted">Product Design Lead</p>
            <p>Redbubble is a global marketplace with millions of artworks and billions of product combinations. In the ‚ÄúFind Your Thing‚Äù team, I led discovery and design for search, uncovering that users struggled to know what to type and often abandoned due to friction. I designed and tested autocomplete suggestions to reduce input effort and surface new content, balancing speed, relevance, and the long-tail complexity of creative searches.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> 30% uplift in search engagement, reduced ‚Äúzero result‚Äù pages, increased add-to-cart, and gave customers more confidence in finding ‚Äútheir thing.‚Äù</p>

            <p class="muted">Product Design Lead</p>
            <p>
              Redbubble is a global marketplace with millions of artworks and billions of product combinations. On the ‚ÄúProduct Decisions‚Äù team, I led research and design to address low add-to-cart rates caused by lack of trust and confidence on product pages. Through user interviews, card sorting, and A/B testing, I identified shipping clarity, product information, realistic previews, and social proof as critical levers. I designed and validated solutions including shipping estimates, product information patterns, similar design suggestions (ML-powered), and community reviews.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Improved add-to-cart by 6% in tested variants, built lasting design patterns for onboarding new products, and increased trust and confidence in Redbubble‚Äôs product quality.</p>

            p Shaun‚Äôs the kind of guy you poke fun at him face to face but you talk highly of him behind his back. He‚Äôs easy going and has a great work attitude. He leaves his ego behind and instead puts forward insights from research and data when making decisions. He‚Äôs in the smaller majority of designers that go far beyond pixels and view product design holistically.

            p Shaun is a talented designer and a sincere team player. He‚Äôs a real asset with a broad skill set, from research through to prototyping, but it‚Äôs his humility that I really like. He constantly collaborates with the other designers at Redbubble, as well as within his product team, and broadens everyone's understanding of the problem they‚Äôre solving.
            p He‚Äôs also not afraid to jump in, take feedback from others and personally grow and learn from it and also raise the bar within the wider design team as well.
